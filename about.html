        <h4>Hello!</h4>
        
        <p>My name is Erman Ramiqi. I'm from Skopje, North Macedonia, the capital city of this country.  I'm almost 20 years old
        and I am currently a student at FINKI. So far my studies are going great, hopefully to go this way during this journey, why not even better.
    <br>I chose this programme to study for because as a kid, computers were my favorite thing. As I grew up I started to understand more 
    about computers and got into coding. It can be a frustration at first but once you get the idea of it, it is going to be much easier. <br>
    My hobbies are playing basketball, videogames and stargazing. Stars are there to remind us that they dont tell the future but the stories that they hear.  </p>
